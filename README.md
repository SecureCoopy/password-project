# Password Generator and Strength Checker

## Description
This Python-based application is designed for generating secure passwords and passphrases, as well as evaluating the strength of custom passwords. It combines random password generation, passphrase creation, and password strength assessment using the `zxcvbn` library.

## Features
- **Random Password Generation**: Create a secure, random password with a specified length.
- **Passphrase Generation**: Generate a passphrase with a user-defined number of words, enhanced with numbers and special characters.
- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Assess the strength of a user-provided password, providing feedback on its security level.
- **Visual Strength Indicator**: Display the strength of the password through a color-coded bar.
- **Educational Fun Facts**: Each password strength assessment is accompanied by a fun fact related to password security.
